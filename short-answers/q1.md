# Question

Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```

to this:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer

When the URL is adjusted and the page refreshes, it is an indiction of information from the form being sent to a server. The browser upon the action of a submission does these things by default. But we can override and stop this type of behavior by using the method `.preventDefault()` in an event handler that would be found on the linked `js` file.
