# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

The default behavior of the button element `<button></button>` is that they have a `type="submit""` which takes the data collected from the form and sends it to a server. This is also the behavior of a button that is explicitly declared with a `type="submit"`
A button with a `type="reset` will have the default behavior that clears inputs and restores their initial, original value.
A button specified with a `type="button"` has no default behavior so nothing will be done upon an event unless there are event listeners in a `js` file that is linked through a script tag.
