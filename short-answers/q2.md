# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
We need labels for every input to create acccessible webpages because they give screen readers the neccesary information to correctly read the program. The two ways to associate a label with an input is assigning the label tag with a `for` attribute that matches the corresponding `id` of the input. The second way to associate these tags together is to have the label tag acting as a "parent" tag to the input tag, in other words, put the input tag directly inside of the label tag.
